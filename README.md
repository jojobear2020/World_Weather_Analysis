Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

This was a fun and challenging project. 

**Pros:**
* Free APIs
* glimpse into how itinerary/weather maps work
* fun to work with ever changing datatset if reset kernel

**Cons:**
* Free API system can be slow and block user from continuing working on the code if limit was exceeded
