Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

This was a fun and challenging project. 

**Pros:**
* Free APIs
* glimpse into how itinerary/weather maps work
* fun to work with ever changing datatset if reset kernel (**Bye long planned Italy trip! :( Hello Australia! :)**)

**Cons:**
* Free API system can be slow and block user from continuing working on the code if limit was exceeded
* gmaps has a few features taht are not availble for a regular user as well. Example - part 3 of the challenge that asked to map itinerary. While it was executed, gmaps does not allow to see the map feature despite enables APIs and signing up tor the low paying plan...
